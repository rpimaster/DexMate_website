                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hello,</p>
                <p>You can call me rpimaster. I am a high school student and also a 15-year type one diabetic. When Dexcom G6 first came out and I got it, I was so excited, and it made my life better. I have always been a "tech guy." I love computers, programming, and making the world better virtually.</p>
                <p>Many times, I caught myself working on some coding project or doing school work, and suddenly my Dexcom was beeping that I was high. I would look at the graph and see that I had been slowly rising for about 30 minutes. I should have acted quicker, but I was very focused on my work on my laptop, and my phone was in another room. This is where the idea of DexMate came about. I know many people who would like to see their numbers on their PC or laptop. Maybe not only us diabetics but also parents who can see their child's Dexcom readings on their work laptop while their child is at school.</p>
                <p>I truly believe it can help a lot of people. I hope it will. Please try it, test it in different situations, and if you find any errors, I would be very grateful for your feedback. Of course, I am only a student and hobby programmer. I tried to test it as much as I can, but I can't guarantee that it will work or that it won't damage your files or computer. Also, I am not a doctor. Nothing I say constitutes medical advice. Always consult with a real doctor before making any interventions or changes to your treatment.</p>
                <p>So use carefully and at your own risk!</p>
                <p>Hope you will enjoy it,</p>
                <p>rpimaster</p>
